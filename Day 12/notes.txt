OOP focuses on creating high reusable objects and classes that conserve their state.

Class    => Blueprint to create objects, contains attributes and methods.
Object   => Instances of class with their own data and state.
__init__ => Initialization function, determines what to do when an object is being initialized. Always returns None.
self     => It refers to the Instance itself, it is automatically passed when working with an object, it reflects the current state of the object and helps bind attributes to the object.

Generally we name classes in pascal-case without using underscores (_).

Code becomes more organized and manageable with the use of classes and objects.
