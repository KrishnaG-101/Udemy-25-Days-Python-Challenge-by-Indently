# Today we will learn about built-in functions in python.

1. Enumerate: enumerate() function allows us to enumerate over a collection. It returns an Iterator (typing module) object.
              It creates an object containing tuples of items and their respective position in the collection, in this manner [(0, Item1), (1, Item 2)].
              We can use enumerate for different number of reasons, one of which is to print a collection of items in a number ordered fashion.
              We can also specify the starting number using the start= argument.
              An enumerate object can only be consumed once.

2. Round: round() function is used to round a number to given nearest decimal places.
          If not supplied an argument for decimal places it will round the number to nearest integer number.
          It can also take negative argument for decimal places to round the integer number to nearest zeros.
          It uses the banker's rounding technique, i.e. If completely centered the number will rounded to nearest even number.
          e.g. round(1.51) -> 2, round(1.49) -> 1, round(1.5) -> 2 and round(2.5) -> 2.

3. Range: range() function is used to create a range of numbers. It creates a range object.
          Syntax: range(start, end, step)  all arguments can be negative given the right usage.
          It can be enumerated and can be easily converted to other collection data types too. Used to create lists and create loops.

4. Slice: slice() function is used to create slice object, that can be used to slice collections or sequences.
          It does not directly slice any collection but kind of stores the slice information in a variable, which .
          e.g. temp : slice = slice(start, end, skip) and collection[temp] to slice.
          If we want to omit an argument (just like in slicing [::2]) we will have to use None. e.g. slice(None, None, 2)
          This helps if we want to slice multiple collections similarly.
